We're pet-friendly and understand the importance of your furry companions in your home. However, for the safety and comfort of both our team and your pets, we kindly request your cooperation with the following guidelines:

*   To ensure a smooth and uninterrupted cleaning experience, please secure any pets that might pose a threat to our team while they are in your home.
*   It's preferable to keep pets that may be sensitive to new people or activities inside a crate or confined space during our cleaning visit. This helps prevent any potential inconveniences or stress for both the pets and our staff.
*   Kindly note that we do not provide cleaning services for pet-related accidents, such as potty or urine cleanup. We appreciate your understanding in this matter.

We value the harmony between your pets and our cleaning procedures and strive to create a safe and comfortable environment for all.
