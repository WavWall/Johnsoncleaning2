We offer flexible payment options to make your experience seamless and convenient. Here are the updated terms:

*   Payment is required at the time of service. We now offer the convenience of autopay by credit card (CC), ensuring a hassle-free experience for you.
*   To ensure the smooth continuity of our services, please be aware that a $10 fee will be incurred for any payment that becomes past due after 5 days from the service date. An additional $1 will be added for each subsequent day past the initial 5 days.
*   Please note that a $35 fee will be applied for any returned checks.
*   In the case of an open invoice remaining unpaid for 45 days without any communication or arrangement for payment, the outstanding balance will be referred to collections. Please understand that in this scenario, customers will be responsible for all costs associated with the collection process.
