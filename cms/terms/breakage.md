It’s bound to happen. We hate it when it does, and we do our best to prevent it! The following is critical communication regarding our breakage policies:

  • Sometimes breakage occurs when there are “booby traps”. Those are accidents waiting to happen (pictures not hung securely, top heavy items with unstable bases, wobbly, tippy objects). Each incident is reviewed on a case-by-case basis. We cannot take responsibility for “booby traps”. Please remove unstable breakables to a place we do not clean (we do not clean inside curios, China cabinets, or clear wet bar shelves).

  • Please move expensive figurines or glassware to a location we do not clean or have us skip that area completely if you do not wish to accept the risk.

  • In some cases, we will have the broken item repaired by a professional restoration company. Breakage values over $25 must be verified before replacement or reimbursement will be authorized. Please save the broken item for our inspection. Breakage must be reported within 24 hours of  discovery.
