Delays can happen, and we will always communicate with you in advance. Unexpected events (example: traffic, road accidents, flat tire, etc.) that are out of our control can cause some delays and will not result in last minute cancellations. We’ll always support the appointment made and will try our best to better accommodate our clients’ needs on the day, but we also expect cooperation and understanding from you.
