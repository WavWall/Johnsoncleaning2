It's preferable to keep pets that may be sensitive to new people or activities inside a crate or confined space during our cleaning visit. This helps prevent any potential inconveniences or stress for both the pets and our staff. Kindly note that we do not provide cleaning services for pet-related accidents, such as potty or urine cleanup. We appreciate your understanding in this matter. We value the harmony between your pets and our cleaning procedures and strive to create a safe and comfortable environment for all."}
