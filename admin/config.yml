We cannot take responsibility for “booby traps”.

Breakage values over $25 must be verified before replacement or reimbursement will be authorized. Please save the broken item for our inspection. Breakage must be reported within 24 hours of \_discovery., key: 106204ad"

              Original text: We're pet-friendly and understand the importance of
              your furry companions in your home. However, for the safety and
              comfort of both our team and your pets, we kindly request your
              cooperation with the following guidelines: To ensure a smooth and
              uninterrupted cleaning experience, please secure any pets that
              might pose a threat to our team while they are in your home. It's
              preferable to keep pets that may be sensitive to new people or
              activities inside a crate or confined space during our cleaning
              visit. This helps prevent any potential inconveniences or stress
              for both the pets and our staff. Kindly note that we do not
              provide cleaning services for pet-related accidents, such as potty
              or urine cleanup. We appreciate your understanding in this matter.
              We value the harmony between your pets and our cleaning procedures
              and strive to create a safe and comfortable environment for all.,
